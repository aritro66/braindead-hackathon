# Codehack_21 - BrainDead Hackathon

This repository contains the submission of the team Codehack_21 for the BrainDead hackathon organized as part of Revelation '23. Our team has worked on two problem statements - "Analyze Placement Data" and "Detecting Emotional Sentiment in Cartoons".

## Problem Statement 1: Analyze Placement Data

In this challenge, we were given a dataset of MBA college students' placement records. The dataset included various factors such as secondary and higher secondary school percentages, degree specializations, work experience, and salary offered to the students. Our task was to analyze the factors that affect the placement and salary of students and derive meaningful insights from the data.

We have performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset and used various machine learning algorithms to analyze the factors affecting placement and salary. Our approach included feature engineering, data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. We have presented our findings and insights in the report.pdf file.

## Problem Statement 2: Detecting Emotional Sentiment in Cartoons

In this challenge, we were given a customized private cartoon dataset of social media posts, which contained labels for each post's emotion category such as happy, angry, sad, or neutral. Our task was to build and fine-tune a machine-learning model that accurately classifies social media posts into their corresponding emotion categories, using synthetic images.

We have used various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning to train the model. Our approach included data preprocessing, data augmentation, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The code for this problem statement can be found in the codehack_21\_\_brain_dead.ipynb file.

## Conclusion

We had a great learning experience while working on these problem statements, and we thank the organizers for providing us with this opportunity. We hope that our submission will be useful for further research and analysis.
